One of the largest talking points with respect to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which just passed a vote in the House last week, is the reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%. Proponents of the bill argue that the corporate tax rate is too high, and that lowering it will bring tax revenue - and more importantly, jobs - back to the US from overseas.

How simple life is when one blissfully ignores the tax rates in popular destinations for corporate relocation such as Canada and Ireland, which sit at 15% and 12.5% respectively. Even with the offer to bring home foreign cash at a 12% rate, it may still make sense for the companies to remain where they are.

The American tax code still includes a provision that allows corporations to indefinitely defer income made overseas, so long as it is not brought back to the US. This has led to corporate flight to countries with lower tax rates, and a [mind-boggling stockpile of cash overseas](http://money.cnn.com/2017/07/19/investing/apple-google-microsoft-cash/index.html), which will not be taxed or reinvested in the economy for the forseeable future.

Though the details are subject to heated debate, it is widely agreed upon across the political spectrum that the tax code needs reform. In [a September CNN poll](http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/27/politics/cnn-poll-immigration-taxes/index.html), 33% of respondents said the federal income tax system needs "major changes"; 35% contended it needs "a complete overhaul".

The most pertinent tax reform question Americans should ask themselves is "What do we want our tax code to do?"

Since its enactment in 1913, the income tax has been inherently _progressive_, meaning it redistributes from high-earners to low-earners. Features like higher tax rates for higher incomes and deductions for students and single mothers make this the case.
