One of the largest talking points with respect to the [Tax Cuts and Jobs Act](https://www.congress.gov/115/bills/hr1/BILLS-115hr1rh.pdf), which just passed a vote in the House last week, is the reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%. Proponents of the bill argue that the corporate tax rate is too high, and that lowering it will bring tax revenue - and more importantly, jobs - back to the US from overseas.

The analysis can only be that simple if one ignores the tax rates in popular destinations for corporate relocation such as Canada and Ireland, which sit at 15% and 12.5% respectively. Even with the offer to bring home cash earned abroad at a 12% rate, it may still make sense for the companies to maintain these foreign cash holds.

In fact, the federal government offered an even sweeter deal in 2004 with the _American Jobs Creation Act_: multinationals could _repatriate_ offshore earnings at a tax rate of 5.25% for a period of one year. The result? According to [an analysis](https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc743593/m1/1/high_res_d/R40178_2009Feb11.pdf) by the Congressional Research Service in 2009, the tax holiday did increase the amount of money repatriated, but had little to no discernible impact on investment. Rather, the evidence points to the money being used to fund stock buybacks, despite the fact that they were prohibited in the Act.

Corporations move their headquarters to a foreign country - a move that is called a _tax inversion_ - largely because the American tax code still includes a provision that permits the indefinite deferal of taxes on income made overseas, so long as it is kept outside the US. This has led to corporate flight to countries with lower tax rates, and a [mind-boggling stockpile](http://money.cnn.com/2017/07/19/investing/apple-google-microsoft-cash/index.html) of cash in overseas subsidiaries, which will not be taxed or reinvested in the economy for the forseeable future.

Though the details are subject to heated debate, it is widely agreed upon across the political spectrum that the tax code needs reform. In [a September CNN poll](http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/27/politics/cnn-poll-immigration-taxes/index.html), 33% of respondents said the federal income tax system needs "major changes"; 35% contended it needs "a complete overhaul".

The primary goal of any tax scheme is to fund the federal government's operations and policies. Yet other goals can be achieved through the way in which it applies taxes, deductions, and credits to different subsections of the population. Since its enactment in 1913, the income tax has been inherently _progressive_, meaning the marginal tax rate increases as one's income increases. Combined with higher credits for low-income parents and deductions for student loans, the system redistributes from high-earners to low-earners.

The version of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed by the House introduces sweeping cuts to a majority of credits and deductions, like those for student loans, tuition waivers for grad students, and medical expenses. These credits and deductions are put in place to incentivize behavior that is good for society: receiving medical treatment, getting a college education, and getting an advanced degree.

Instead, standard deductions and the child tax credit are expanded, which apply to everyone regardless of socioeconomic status. Moreover, the bill collapses the existing income tax brackets into four groups, and increases the income threshold for the 39.6% top tax rate. The estate tax threshold would be double, so that transfers of wealth from deceased relatives below $11 million are now exempt from tax. The proposed changes apply a more uniform tax structure to the American population, where larger groups in the income distribution pay more similar effective tax rates. 

Consider an extreme example of a flat tax rate, in which a 20% income tax is paid without deductions by everyone in the country. A person earning $12,000 per year would pay $2,400 under this system, while a person earning $300,000 would pay $60,000. For the low-earner, that $2,400 could cover their rent for a few months, but instead they have the remaining $9,600 to live off of. Meanwhile, the high-earner keeps a very healthy $240,000. In economic terms, the _marginal utility_ of the $2,400 for the low-earner is far greater than the marginal utility of the $60,000 for the high-earner.

The Trump tax plan is nowhere near comparable to such a system, but it does take a step in that direction. The Tax Policy Center [finds that](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/distributional-analysis-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act-passed-house-ways-and-means-committee/full) while many households receive tax cuts, the "largest cuts, in dollars and as a percentage of after-tax income, would accrue to higher-income households."

Questions about the level of the corporate tax rate or the top individual tax rate may be valid, but they should not dominate the discussion, since the underlying structure of the tax code has become far more important in recent years. The most pertinent tax reform question Americans should ask themselves is "What do we want our tax code to do?"
