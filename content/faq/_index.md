**Where does the name "Gaussian Sheep" come from?**

The Phillip K. Dick novel [_Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Androids_Dream_of_Electric_Sheep%3F) poses the eponymous question as a dystopian human society tries to find its humanity. Androids serve as foils in this regard, seeing as they feel no empathy. Having long been compared to robots, the Economists here would like to affirm their humanity. We too dream of sheep, though only [Gaussian ones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution).
