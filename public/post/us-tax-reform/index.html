<p>One of the largest talking points with respect to the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/115/bills/hr1/BILLS-115hr1rh.pdf">Tax Cuts and Jobs Act</a>, which just passed a vote in the House on November 16, is the reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%. Proponents of the bill argue that the corporate tax rate is too high, and that lowering it will bring tax revenue - and more importantly, jobs - back to the US from overseas.</p>

<p>The analysis can only be that simple if one ignores the tax rates in popular destinations for corporate relocation such as Canada and Ireland, which sit at 15% and 12.5% respectively. Lowering the rate might help prevent more <em>tax inversions</em> from occurring in the future, but it could ultimately prove insufficient to bring home already-relocated firms. Even with the offer to bring home cash earned abroad at a 12% rate, it may still make sense for the companies to maintain these foreign cash holds.</p>

<p>In fact, the federal government offered an even sweeter deal in 2004 with the <em>American Jobs Creation Act</em>: multinationals could <em>repatriate</em> offshore earnings at a tax rate of 5.25% for a period of one year. The result? According to <a href="https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc743593/m1/1/high_res_d/R40178_2009Feb11.pdf">an analysis</a> by the Congressional Research Service (CRS) in 2009, the tax holiday did increase the amount of money repatriated, but had little to no discernible impact on investment. Rather, the evidence points to the money being used to fund stock buybacks, despite the fact that they were prohibited in the Act.</p>

<p>This same CRS report highlights an important piece of economic theory, which states that raising after-tax profits is not likely to spur investment since the <em>relative cost</em> of investment - as compared to stock repurchases for example - has not changed. Cutting taxes gives corporations more money to work with, but the opportunity to invest is equally as (un)attractive as it was before.</p>

<p>Though job creation will attract more attention, recent academic exploration into the economic inequality <em>between</em> companies highlights another issue. In their paper <a href="http://www.econ.ucla.edu/tvwachter/papers/FUI_website_NBER_SI.pdf"><em>Firming Up Inequality</em> (2016)</a>, the authors find that the majority of the rise in income inequality from 1981 to 2013 can be attributed to the rise in income inequality between firms over that period. Widening earnings inequality has less to do with larger pay gaps between CEO’s and assistants at the same company, and more to do with larger pay gaps between employees at Google and those at Joe’s Consulting LLC.</p>

<p>Reducing the tax rate applied to Google and General Motors, as well as reducing the tax rate applied to their foreign earnings, will only augment these between-firm income disparities. TRANSITION HERE TO CHANGES TO INDIVIDUAL TAXES</p>

<h3 id="tax-cuts-for-all"><em>Tax Cuts For All?</em></h3>

<p>Since its enactment in 1913, the income tax has been inherently <em>progressive</em>, meaning the marginal tax rate increases as one&rsquo;s income increases. Combined with higher credits for low-income parents and deductions for student loans, the system redistributes from high-earners to low-earners.</p>

<p>The degree to which this happens changes with the House’s version of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, in which the majority of the tax cuts go to the wealthy. The Tax Policy Center <a href="http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/distributional-analysis-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act-passed-house-ways-and-means-committee/full">finds that</a> while many households receive tax cuts, the &ldquo;largest cuts, in dollars and as a percentage of after-tax income, would accrue to higher-income households.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The bill additionally introduces sweeping cuts to a majority of credits and deductions, like those for student loans, tuition waivers for grad students, and medical expenses. These credits and deductions were put in place to incentivize behavior that is good for society: receiving medical treatment, getting a college education, and getting an advanced degree. Yet they mainly benefit the people that would like to take these actions, but can’t afford to. From an economics standpoint, it is extremely inefficient for citizens to be willing and unable to take an action that has a positive impact on society.</p>

<p>Instead, standard deductions and the child tax credit are expanded, which apply to everyone regardless of socioeconomic status. Moreover, the bill collapses the existing income tax brackets into four groups, and increases the income threshold for the 39.6% top tax rate. The estate tax threshold would be double, so that transfers of wealth from deceased relatives below $11 million are now exempt from tax. The proposed changes apply a more uniform tax structure to the American population than before, where larger sections of the income distribution pay more similar <em>effective tax rates</em>.</p>

<p>Taking uniformity to its extreme, consider a flat tax rate without deductions, in which a 20% income tax is paid by everyone in the country. A person earning $12,000 per year would pay $2,400 under this system, while a person earning $300,000 per year would pay $60,000. For the low-earner, that $2,400 could cover their rent for a few months, but instead they have the remaining $9,600 to live off of. The extra $60,000 would be nice to have for the high-earner, but it is not as necessary for their rent or mortgage payments, since they keep a healthy $240,000. In economic terms, the <em>marginal utility</em> of the $2,400 for the low-earner is far greater than the marginal utility of the $60,000 for the high-earner.</p>

<p>The Trump tax plan is nowhere near comparable to such a system, but it certainly takes a step in that direction. Crucial to consideration of any tax plan is not any one feature, but how all parts function as a whole. Questions about the level of the corporate tax rate or the top individual tax rate may be valid, but they should not dominate the discussion, since the underlying structure of the tax code is far more important.</p>

<p>What, then, should be the focus of US tax reform? The primary goal of any tax scheme is to fund the federal government&rsquo;s operations and policies. Yet other goals are achieved through the way in which the government applies taxes, deductions, and credits to different subsections of the population.</p>

<p>The most pertinent tax reform question Americans can ask themselves is &ldquo;What do we want our tax code to do?&rdquo; At the moment, proposed reforms will only widen pay disparities.</p>
